Project Statement: Sales Analysis and Profit Optimization

In this project I performed an in-depth analysis of a sales dataset to gain insights into sales trends, customer segments, and profitability. The goal was to identify opportunities for optimizing profits and improving sales strategies for the business.
This portfolio project showcases my skills in data analysis, and data visualization. I've used Google Sheets for data analysis and for data hosting, and I've created a dashboard to provide insights into the sales data.

Project Highlights

- **Sales Trends Analysis**: Explored monthly and quarterly sales trends to identify patterns and fluctuations in sales revenue and quantity sold.
- Profitability Analysis: Calculated profit margins for product categories and sub-categories, highlighting categories with the highest and lowest profits.
- Shipping Cost Impact Analysis: Analyzed how shipping costs and order priority affect profit margins.
