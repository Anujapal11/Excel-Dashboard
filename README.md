# Business Performance Analysis Report

**Project Statement**: Sales Analysis and Profit Optimization

In this project I performed an in-depth analysis of a sales dataset to gain insights into sales trends, customer segments, and profitability. The goal was to identify opportunities for optimizing profits and improving sales strategies for the business.
This portfolio project showcases my skills in data analysis, and data visualization. I've used Google Sheets for data analysis and for data hosting, and I've created a dashboard to provide insights into the sales data.

**Project Highlights**

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Explored monthly and quarterly sales trends to identify patterns and fluctuations in sales.
- **Profitability Analysis:** Calculated total profit and profit margins for product categories and sub-categories.
- **Shipping Cost Impact Analysis:** Analyzed how shipping costs and order priority affect profit margins.
- **Region Analysis:** Conducted an analysis of sales and profitability based on different regions.
